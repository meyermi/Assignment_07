Introduction 
Today I am going to talk about two different topics. The first topic I’d like to talk about is when to use a SQL UDF. The second topic will be about the differences between Scalar, Inline and Multi-Statement Functions.
when to use a SQL UDF 
SQL User Defined Functions can greatly reduce time spent managing and manipulating data. Once a UDF is created and stored, it can be used at any time. The use of UDF’s greatly reduces network traffic. 
Scalar, Inline and Multi-Statement Functions
Scalar, Inline and Multi Statement Functions are all different forms of User Defined Functions. Scalar Functions accept multiple parameters and return a single result. Multi Statement Functions accept multiple parameters and the return is specified by the input table variant. Inline Functions return a similar result set to views, however they can use multiple parameters, unlike views.  
Summary
In conclusion, we have discussed when you would use SQL User Defined Functions. We have also discussed the differences between Inline, Scalar and Multi -Statement Functions.
